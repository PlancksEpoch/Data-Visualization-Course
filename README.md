# Data Visualization Course
This repo showcases the semester-long analysis of Corgi's video games dataset using visualizations. It concludes with a dual visualization that justifies using virtual environments to study human behavior.

## Project Proposal Synopsis
There is a need for methodological innovation in cognitive science research and video games are likely contenders for various reasons.

## Final Project Synopsis
I created a side-by-side visualization that compares the usefulness of video games to drosophila (a transformative research adoption in genetic biology) and a showcase of the data-driven exclusion process on the Corgis data set to select suitable games for experimentation.
