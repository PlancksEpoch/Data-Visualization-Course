# Data Visualization Course Repository
This repository features the semester-long analysis of the Corgis video games dataset. It explores the potential of video games as tools for cognitive science research, culminating in a dual visualization that underscores their utility and provides a systematic exclusion process for identifying suitable game titles for behavioral experiments.

## Data Information
The dataset originates from the Corgis repository and includes self-reported metrics on 1,213 video game titles spanning 48 unique genre combinations. It was collected via phone interviews and provides insights into sales, gameplay durations, and genre popularity.

## Project Proposal Synopsis
The project was inspired by the pressing need for methodological innovation in cognitive science. Traditional tasks in this field often lack ecological validity, failing to replicate real-world behaviors. Video games present an innovative solution, offering dynamic, engaging, and repeatable environments for studying cognitive processes.
Key questions addressed:
1. Can video games help address the replication crisis in cognitive science?
2. Which game titles from the dataset are best suited as ecologically valid tasks for psychophysiological research?
The proposal outlines a systematic approach to identifying suitable games, using exclusion criteria to focus on those that balance experimental practicality and cognitive engagement. The driving metaphor was inspired by the fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*), a model organism that transformed genetic research, suggesting video games could play a similar transformative role in cognitive science.

## Final Project Synopsis

### Visualization Overview
The final project showcases a dual visualization:
1. A side-by-side comparison illustrating the potential of video games as "the Drosophila of cognitive science."
2. A systematic exclusion process using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to identify two candidate games: Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli and GRID. These games were selected based on criteria such as:
   - Genre: Driving games
   - Duration: Rushed completion times under 25 hours
   - Platform: Console-based
   - Rating: "E for Everyone"

### Key Insights
- Video games offer controlled, immersive, and ecologically valid environments, ideal for studying decision-making, memory, and spatial navigation.
- Like the fruit fly in biology, video games are repeatable, ethically sound, and adaptable, allowing for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies.
